      "Chez Georges stands out as a hidden gem in Brazil, located in the Santa Teresa district within a Brutalist building designed by Wladimir Alves de Souza in the Seventies. Its interiors defy Brutalism stereotypes by making it warm and inviting, blending Brazilian mood with European modernism, with richly textured materials and bold colors. The seven suites, named after famous musicians, have luxurious furnishings, including pieces by Brazilian modernist Ricardo Fasanello and European finds from Paris, Brussels, and Ghent. Beyond the stylish accommodations, the hotel offers charming common spaces like a swimming pool, studio recording, panoramic roof terrace, and a patio with a vaulted concrete pergola.",

    description:
      "The Haight store, imagined by Brazilian architects AIA Estudio and Raphael Tepedino, had the challenge to represent the brand’s essence which focuses on nature in a mall. A central pillar, initially an obstacle, becomes the focal point, and the curved lines initiates the customer journey. The ‘Terracor' material which echoes natural and organic materials, cover walls and ceilings, as if subject to erosion. Thoughtful lighting enhances the overall atmosphere creating an inviting creek inside the mall.",
