      "Every face you see is a story you’ve written. A strong gaze becomes cold. A soft expression, fragile. You see what you expect to see and decide what I am before you truly look. We all do it—assigning roles, fitting people into boxes, building identities out of assumptions. But these roles are not mine alone. They are shaped by your gaze, your expectations, your reflection staring back at you. And in every person, there’s a truth — and a lie. ‘The Role You Gave Me’ is about perception—yours, mine, and ours. Each portrait challenges you to confront the roles we impose on others and, by extension, on ourselves. They reflect the clichés we cling to, the judgments we make, and the truths we ignore. This isn’t just about observing; it’s about being observed. It’s about realizing that every look shapes a story, and every story reveals something about the storyteller. Who are you, really, in the roles you give others?",
